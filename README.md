## Environment Variables
Check `.env` file to configure the environment variables.

You would need:
- `TOKEN_DISCORD`: This is the token generated by discord, get yours at [Discord Developer Portal]("https://discord.com/developers/")

- `TOKEN_ECLESIAR`: This is the permanent Auth token provided by eclesiar, that will be used sending API request.
``Authorization':  `Bearer ${process.env.TOKEN_ECLESIAR}``
Create a ticket and contact their dev(Caldeira) to get yours.

Optional:
- `SESSION_ECLESIAR`: This is the session cookie of your eclesiar account, that might be used when sending API request.
``'Cookie': `ECLESIARSESS=${process.env.SESSION_ECLESIAR}``.
